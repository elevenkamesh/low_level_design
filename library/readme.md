Interview Question: Design a Library Management System
Design a system for a library that allows users to borrow and return books.

Requirements:

The library has multiple books. Each book has a title, author, ISBN, and an availability status.

Users can register in the system.

A user can borrow a book only if it is available.

A user can return a book they have borrowed.

A book can be borrowed by only one user at a time.

The system should support:
• listing all available books
• listing all borrowed books
• listing all books borrowed by a specific user

Design expectations (what interviewer wants):
• Identify the main classes
• Define relationships between them
• Define important methods
• Explain the flow of borrowing and returning
• Apply OOP principles
• Keep the system extendable

This is exactly how an interviewer would pose the question — short, clear, and open-ended. You are supposed to drive the modelling from here.

Whenever you’re ready, describe your class design and I’ll evaluate it like an interviewer, help you refine it, and push you toward real LLD muscle.
